Getting Python\nMacs come with Python already, but what we want is Anaconda, which includes over 330 of the most used packages, ipython and the ipython notebook.  There is a quick start guide here https://store.continuum.io/static/img/Anaconda-Quickstart.pdf, but the general steps are as follows:\n\n1. Go to https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/.\n2. Click the \"Download Anaconda\" link.\n\n  **NOTE**: At this point you face a choice: 2.7 or 3.4.  We will use Python 3.4 for this course, but I have experienced some compatability issues (in particular with PyCUDA), so be aware that this may be a problem.}\n\n3. Click \"I want Python 3.4\"\n4. Click the download link below \"Choose your installer...\"  It should say something like \"Windows 64-Bit Python 3.4 Graphical Installer\".  BE SURE IT SAYS \"64-Bit\"!!!!!  Also, be sure you have a 64 bit processor... if you have a 32-bit you should probably have updated it a decade ago...\n5. When the download is complete, double click the file and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nYou should now be able to open IPython or an IPython Notebook from the command line.  Simply type `ipython` or `ipython notebook` in a terminal.\n\n## 2. Getting a Text Editor\nThis section should be titled getting THE text editor, as it is completely biased.  However, having spent time testing several editors, I find that Atom is the most intuitive and the easiest to set up (it also has some nice technical features for the future, but we'll talk about that in class).  So this section will cover Atom, but feel free to use whatever editor you like.  My second choice would be Sublime Text Editor.\n\n**WARNING:** Atom cannot run on Windows XP or earlier... sorry!  If you are in this situation I would suggest VIM, but it is a true pain so you're on your own.\n\n1. Go to https://atom.io/.\n2. Click the download installer link.\n3. Open the .exe file you just downloaded and follow the instructions.\n\nBoom!  You're done!  So easy.  Now there are a few extra steps to take to get Atom running great for Python.\n\nFirst, we are going to set some preferences.\n\n1. Navigate to Edit > Preferences.  From here you can change the settings to your choices.\n2. You MUST turn on \"Soft Tabs\" and set \"Tab Length\" to 4.  Python does not use braces to delineate functions or loops, but 4 spaces.  This makes presentation neater and code easier to read.\n\nLast, we will install a linter to verify that your code meets the community standards in PEP8, the active style guide. **NOTE:** This step can only be performed after you have installed Anaconda.\n\n1. Open a terminal.\n2. Install the linter package by typing \"atom install linter\" or \"apm install linter\", depending on if you have mac, windows or linux.  Try each command and use the one that works in the future.\n3. Next we need to install the flake8 linter package, but this type of third party package management can be a pain in Anaconda.  To begin try running the following:\n\n        conda install flake8\n        conda install flake8-docstrings\n        atom install linter-flake8\n        \n\n  If you get no error messages, great!  If this doesn't work, you'll need to locate the directory where you installed Anaconda and then run the following:\n\n        cd /path/to/anaconda\n        pip install flake8\n        pip install flake8-docstrings\n        atom install linter-flake8\n\n  If you are still having trouble and have tried to ask Google, send me an email and I will try to help.\n  \n  When you are done you should be able to save a practice file, say `practice.py` (notice the `.py` is the file extension for Python scripts) and type some code.  The linter will automatically highlight the code and give you warnings for errors and style violations.\n\n## 3. GitHub\nGitHub is ubiquitous in open source software and if you ever want to contribute to a project you will need to be able to use it.  GitHub is also a great tool for storing and publishing your own code, as well as tracking changes or even hosting free static html websites.  Conclusion: use GitHub!\n\nThere is a great tutorial here: http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1 .  I suggest you read through that whole article and set up your own GitHub account at www.github.com  .  The process of setting up git and creating local repos is quite long, so it is more efficient to just send you to the GitHub help here: https://help.github.com/ .  You should follow their steps (the site detects your operating system automatically) and try to get set-up yourself.  There is also a great page with information on the basic process here: https://guides.github.com/ .  We will go over in class the main idea behind GitHub, but if you have specific questions please contact me.\n\nThat should do it.  You now have a full Python installation with many packages and a great text editor that will correct your syntax and style in real time!  If you have problems with any of the steps here, please let me know.\n\n"
