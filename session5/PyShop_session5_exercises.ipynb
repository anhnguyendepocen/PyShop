More precisely, we have a series of observations $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ ($x_i = 1$ if heads, $x_i = 0$ if tails) drawn from the distribution\n",

    "2.  Write a function that takes a value of $n$ and a value of $p$ (the 'true' value), and returns a random sample $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x_i$ corresponds to the flipping of an unfair coin.\n",

Since the calculation of $p_{k+1}$ depends on $p_k$ and since the sample only needs to be calculated once, the estimation process cannot be parallelized outside of the summation.  Since a basic summation is a pain to parallelize and since NumPy is so fast, this is rather pointless.  However, we could parallelize drawing the sample!  Create a function within your class object that uses multiprocessing to parallelize the sample generation and add the option as a keyword argument.\n",

Try to plot time to execute, the estimated value of $p$, and the variance of the estimators in each extimation procedure (ie $\\mathbb{V}(p_k)$ as a function of $n$).\n",
