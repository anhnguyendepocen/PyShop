    "Consider an economy with $N$ who live for two periods.  Agents preferences are CRRA.  Agents are heterogeneous in their preference parameter, $\\gamma_i$, which is drawn from a distribution at time $t=1$ (NOTE: You can choose the distribution to be discrete and the values to be only whole numbers to make your life much easier.  This is what I did in the solutions, but it is solvable over a continuous distribution.).  Agents are fully rational and aware of all other agents' preferences (to avoid any sort of information problems).  They discount at a rate $\\beta$.\n",
